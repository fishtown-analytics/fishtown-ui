# Code Practices

## Populating the Args Table

In order for the documentation engine to properly infer types from your component you must implement your components typing in a specific way.

### Bad

```tsx
import React from 'react';

export const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = () => ...
```

### Good

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';

export const MyComponent: FC<Props> = () => ...
```

## Styling components

We use tailwind as a utility CSS library with a customized prefix `tw-*`. In a lot of simple cases you might not need to build your own .css file for a component.
Just use the provided tailwind classes directly on markup.

### Bad

```html
<style>
  .myComponent {
    display: block;
    background: #23435;
  }

  .myComponent div {
    color: white;
  }
</style>

<MyComponent>
  <div>...</div>
</MyComponent>
```

### Good

```html
<MyComponent className="tw-block tw-bg-teal-500">
  <div className="tw-text-white">...</div>
</MyComponent>
```

## Extracted Components

In more complex components you might need to supply some CSS. These cases usually come about when there is some intended visual state change in a component.
By applying classes and swapping state based parent classes you can drive large scale visual change with simple javascript rather than a lot of conditional class names throughout your html structure.

When providing a new css file it's important to include it in the right tailwind _layer_, this will ensure source order and include the component's styles alongside other component styles.

### Bad

```css
.my-class {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class--focused {
  color: teal;
}
```

### _Better_

```css
@layer components {
  .my-class {
    color: blue;
  }

  .my-class--focused {
    color: teal;
  }
}
```

When writing CSS strive to use tailwind's _apply_ rather than writing css directly. This allows for theming and consistency in sizes/colors/etc.

### Bad

```css
@layer components {
  .my-class {
    color: blue;
  }

  .my-class--focused {
    color: teal;
  }
}
```

### Good

```css
@layer components {
  .my-class {
    @apply tw-text-blue-500;
  }

  .my-class--focused {
    @apply tw-text-teal-500;
  }
}
```
